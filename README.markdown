# **🎬 SubtitleSync: Perfectly Timed Subtitles, Every Time!**  

A seamless solution to fix subtitle timing issues in videos. Whether your subtitles lag behind or race ahead, SubtitleSync aligns them perfectly, ensuring an immersive viewing experience without the hassle of manual adjustments.



## **✨ Features**
- 🎥 **Supports Multiple Video Formats**: Works with MP4, MKV, and more.
- ⏱️ **Precise Timing Adjustments**: Fixes offsets of up to ±3 seconds.
- 🛠️ **Automated Processing**: Detects and corrects misaligned subtitles effortlessly.
- 📝 **SRT Compatibility**: Processes standard subtitle files (.srt).
- ⚡ **Fast and Lightweight**: Designed for efficiency and ease of use.



## **📋 Requirements**
To run SubtitleSync, ensure the following are installed on your system:

### **Core Tools**
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher  
- **FFmpeg**: A powerful tool for handling multimedia files  
  ➡️ [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)  

### **Python Libraries**
Install required dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- `pysrt` for subtitle file handling
- `ffmpeg-python` for video processing
- `numpy` and `scipy` for advanced computations



## **🚀 Installation**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SubtitleSync.git
cd SubtitleSync
```

### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## **📖 Usage**
### **Quick Start**
1. Place your video and subtitle files in the `input/` folder.
2. Run the synchronization script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. Find your corrected subtitle file in the `output/` folder.

### **Command-line Options**
Customize inputs and outputs:
```bash
python src/main.py --video "input/video.mp4" --subtitle "input/subtitle.srt" --output "output/synced_subtitle.srt"
```



## **🔍 How It Works**
1. **Audio Analysis**: Extracts the audio track from the video using FFmpeg.  
2. **Timing Adjustment**: Analyzes subtitle offsets and applies corrections dynamically.  
3. **Output Generation**: Saves the corrected subtitle file in `.srt` format, perfectly synced to your video.
